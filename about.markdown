![Cole-Brazell](images/IMG_2311.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Hi! My name is Cole and I'm a software engineer currently studying at California Polytechnic State University. I enjoy working on projects that allow me to express my creativity and always work above and beyond to create a pixel-perfect product that I am proud to share. 

I have a lot of experience working with Java, Python, and Machine Code. I have had further experience working with C and Arduino.

I'm currently looking for new opportunities so feel free to send me an email if you liked my work on Github
