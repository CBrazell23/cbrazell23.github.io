<p style="color:dimgray;font-size:20px;font-family:candara;">Hi! My name is Cole and I'm a software engineer currently studying at California Polytechnic State University. I enjoy working on projects that allow me to express my creativity and always work above and beyond to create a pixel-perfect product that I am proud to share.</p>

<p style="color:dimgray;font-size:20px;font-family:candara;">When I'm not working behind the computer, I love being out in nature. The perfect day for me includes backpacking to a remote location with a lake where I can swim, cliff jump, and rock climb, with the day ending sitting around a campfire.</p>
