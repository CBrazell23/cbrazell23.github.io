<strong>Fibonnaci</strong>
<p>Created a project at https://github.com/csc225spring20/asgn6-CBrazell23 that uses Assembly language and C which allows the user to input which number of the fibonnaci sequence they would like to know and then returns that number. This project demonstrates ability to use recursion within Assembly</p>

<strong>Translation Project</strong>
<p>Created a project at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mZTw22FuZeejU5y0Lum6mOrnkodL6DoZ7PZmEx4IUl0/edit?usp=sharing that demonstrates my ability to write technically in a way that simplifies difficult language for more readers to understand.
